TODO
- Fix: The NonLinear propagation is not working.
- No NotImplementedError exceptions.
- Unit test: target coverage -> over 90%

Improve performance
 - Try with more efficient data shapes for numpy
 - Try with parallel processing with more high-level APIs. With the high-level APIs,
    it would be easy to extend to use more CPU, GPU, and other systems(e.g., Cloud computing)

Improve design
 - Inject transducer (no if.. else.. for specific types)
 - Inject diffraction types (no if.. else.. for specific types)
 - Save simulation data into the file(s)
    - Has to be programming language & platform independent format.
 - Load simulation data from the file(s)
 - Visualize progress of the simulation
    - Use ParaView
    - with time slide bar
 - Custom phantom designer
 - Capture RF data at transducer
    - Save received RF data
    - Visualize received RF data
